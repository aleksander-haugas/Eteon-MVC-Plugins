# Eteon MVC Plugins
Eteon allows you to host and build websites or web apps. Eteon contains plugin architecture and a template system, so you can customize any website to fit your business, blog, portfolio, or online store.

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.
